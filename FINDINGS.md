# Tropico (PopTop, 2001) — reverse-engineering findings

Target: **GOG build**, `Tropico.EXE`, 1,916,928 bytes, md5 `d05353b7c19d3be1ac2a11e01728b417`.
Plain unpacked PE32, imagebase `0x400000`, six normal sections, `.text` entropy 6.07.
**For every section, file offset == VA − 0x400000**, so static patching needs no translation.

Everything below marked VERIFIED was read out of the disassembly or measured directly.
Anything else is labelled.

---

## 1. The resolution table — VERIFIED

VA `0x5a0fa0`, file offset `0x1a0fa0`. Five entries, `struct { DWORD width; DWORD height; }`.

| slot | dimensions | file offset | aspect |
|------|------------|-------------|--------|
| 0 | 640 x 480   | 0x1a0fa0 | 4:3 |
| 1 | 800 x 600   | 0x1a0fa8 | 4:3 |
| 2 | 1024 x 768  | 0x1a0fb0 | 4:3 |
| 3 | 1280 x 1024 | 0x1a0fb8 | 5:4 |
| 4 | 1600 x 1200 | 0x1a0fc0 | 4:3 |

Stride 8 is proven, not assumed — ~31 call sites use the idiom:

```asm
mov  eax,[ecx+0x18]        ; resolution index
shl  eax,0x3               ; x8  -> stride is 8
mov  edx,[eax+0x5a0fa4]    ; height
mov  ecx,[eax+0x5a0fa0]    ; width
```

**The table cannot be extended.** `0x5a0fc8` is hardcoded as the loop terminator at
`0x514e46` *and* is a separate live variable (written as a DWORD at `0x458ffa`, read as
a byte at `0x516f8b`). The descriptor array also reserves exactly 5 slots per bit depth.
Higher resolutions must **replace** an entry — the same constraint Ligushka hit in the
Star Trek: Armada II patch.

Note the stock table is *not* uniformly 5:4. Four entries are 4:3 and only slot 3 is 5:4,
so the engine already renders correctly at two different aspect ratios.

## 2. Mode enumeration and the desktop-width gate — VERIFIED

Function `0x514d60`:

1. `rep stos` zeroes the descriptor array at `0x60c998` (0x5A00 bytes).
2. Walks the table, and for each entry writes a pixel-format record at
   `0x60c9d8 + ((idx + 5*is16bpp) << 7)` — RGB555 masks for 8bpp, RGB565 for 16bpp.
3. Terminates on `cmp eax,0x5a0fc8`.

The gate, at `0x514d96`:

```asm
cmp  eax,0x5a0fa0
je   accept                ; slot 0 is always accepted
cmp  [eax],ebx             ; table width vs ebx
jge  next                  ; SKIP if width >= ebx
```

`ebx` is `[0x60c118]`, set at `0x515160` from
`USER32!GetDC(NULL)` + `GDI32!GetDeviceCaps(hdc, 8=HORZRES)`, released via `ReleaseDC`.
IAT slots resolved by parsing the import descriptors: `0x61f788`=GetDC,
`0x61f504`=GetDeviceCaps, `0x61f78c`=ReleaseDC.
`0x60c984` (VERTRES) is written once and **never read**. `0x60a838` is BITSPIXEL.

A skipped entry keeps an all-zero descriptor.

## 3. The "Unable to change to WxH" path — VERIFIED

`0x491336` builds a composite index from the settings object and tests the descriptor:

```asm
mov eax,[0x612fec]
mov ecx,[eax+0x0c] / edx,[eax+0x10] / edi,[eax+0x14] / ebx,[eax+0x1c]
... lea/lea/lea, shl 6 ...          ; 64-byte granularity
mov ebp,[eax+0x60c998]
test ebp,ebp
je   fail                            ; zero descriptor -> error
```

`fail` emits `Tropico.lng` string **586** = `"Unable to change to %1 x %2 resolution"`.
It is a clean dialog, **not** a crash.

Working the arithmetic: the enumerator fills record `2*idx + 10*is16bpp + 1`, and the
lookup computes `120*[+0x0c] + 40*[+0x10] + 10*[+0x14] + 2*idx + [+0x1c]`. These agree
only when `[+0x14] == is16bpp` and `[+0x1c] == 1`.

## 4. TROPICO.CFG format — VERIFIED

Loader `0x438fcc`, save path `0x4391f0`. Magic DWORD then four raw block reads:

| file range | size | destination |
|---|---|---|
| 0x000 | 4 | magic `0x23b8` |
| 0x004..0x126 | 0x123 | `[0x5f2170]` |
| 0x127..0x16c | 0x046 | `[0x60a658]` |
| 0x16d..0x229 | 0x0bd | `[0x616380]` |
| 0x22a..0x30d | 0x0e4 | `[0x612fec]` — video settings |

`4 + 0x123 + 0x46 + 0xbd + 0xe4 = 782` = exact file size.

`[0x612fec]` is the object every table reader indexes with `[+0x18]`:

| field | file offset | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| +0x18 | **0x242** | **resolution index (0..4)** |
| +0x14 | 0x23e | must equal is16bpp for the descriptor lookup to resolve |
| +0x1c | 0x246 | must be 1, ditto |
| +0x48 | **0x272** | **detail preset -> stomps +0x18 (see below)** |

## 5. The preset stomp — VERIFIED BY MEASUREMENT

`0x5159e8`:

```asm
mov eax,[0x612fec]
mov edx,[0x61aeb8]              ; preset selector
mov ecx,[eax+edx*4+0x48]        ; canned value
mov [eax+0x18],ecx              ; OVERWRITES the resolution index
```

This is the readme's *"Tropico detects your machine's specifications and adjusts certain
game parameters accordingly"*. Writing only file `0x242` before launch is silently
overwritten on map load. **This invalidated four consecutive widescreen experiments** —
each reported an identical error because each was really requesting slot 4.

The two arrays overlap: `+0x40[2]` and `+0x48[0]` are the same byte at file `0x272`.
Observed `[0x61aeb8] == 0`; values 0 and 1 are both plausible, so a forcing tool should
cover `0x272` and `0x276`.

The three (and only three) writers of `[obj+0x18]` are `0x514f44`, `0x5155ab` (bulk
settings-apply from stack args) and `0x5159e8` (this stomp).

## 6. Fullscreen vs windowed — CORRECTED

An earlier draft of this file claimed the renderer is always windowed and never calls
`SetDisplayMode`. **That was wrong** — it was inferred from a failing trace only.

Comparing a successful 1600x1200 session against a failing one:

| | successful | failing |
|---|---|---|
| `SetDisplayMode` calls | 3 — 640x480, 1024x768, 1600x1200, all bpp 16 | **0** |
| cooperative level | `DDSCL_FULLSCREEN\|ALLOWREBOOT\|EXCLUSIVE` (x3) + `DDSCL_NORMAL` (x5) | `DDSCL_NORMAL` only |
| rendering | exclusive fullscreen | windowed + clipper into an offscreen surface |

So the game normally takes exclusive fullscreen and sets a 16bpp mode. Windowed operation
with a clipper is the **failure path**, not the design.

It calls `GetDisplayMode` immediately before creating the primary surface, and
`EnumDisplayModes` once at startup (callback `0x52D4D0`).

### Leading hypothesis — NOT yet tested

CFG `+0x1c` (file `0x246`) correlates exactly with this split: it was **0** in every
working configuration and **1** in every failing one. The loader sets it explicitly at
`0x439173` (`mov dword [eax+0x1c],1`) under a condition involving `[0x5f1fe8]`, in the
same function that references the `"ForceWin"` string at `0x58a4a0`. That is consistent
with `+0x1c` being a force-windowed flag.

If true, the tier-3 failures may have nothing to do with widescreen at all — the game may
simply have been stuck in windowed mode. **Test before believing.**

An earlier arithmetic derivation in §3 concluded `[+0x1c]` must be 1 for the descriptor
lookup to resolve. Since `+0x1c == 0` is empirically the working state, that derivation is
wrong somewhere and should not be relied on.

The error format string is at `0x5a8f8c`:
`"DirectDraw Error #%1,  file '%2',  line# %3"`, with 33 call sites. The number comes
from `esi` at each site (runtime, not a constant), so `#150` cannot be grepped to one site.

## 7. Wine's mode list

Wine enumerates a fixed standard set **plus the current virtual desktop size**:
320x200, 320x240, 400x300, 512x384, 640x400, 640x480, 768x576, 800x600, 1024x768,
1152x864, 1280x720, 1280x800, 1280x960, 1280x1024, 1366x768, 1400x1050, 1440x900,
1600x900, 1680x1050, 1920x1080 — each at 8/16/32bpp.

**1600x1200 is not in that set**, so it only exists when the desktop is set to exactly
1600x1200. Prefer table values already in the standard list.

Measured directly (`probes/ddsurf.c`): at 1600x900 and 1600x896 under a matching desktop,
`SetDisplayMode`, primary+flip creation, `Lock` (exact pitch, zero padding) and offscreen
surface creation **all succeed**. DirectDraw does not object to widescreen.


## 8. The SECOND resolution table — a code compare-chain — VERIFIED

Patching only the data table at `0x5a0fa0` is **not sufficient**. A parallel mapping lives
in code at `0x52d15a`, inside the DirectDraw wrapper. It takes an enumerated display mode
(`ecx`=width, `edx`=height) and maps it back to a slot index using stock dimensions:

```asm
cmp ecx,0x640 (1600) / cmp edx,0x4b0 (1200)  -> index 4
cmp ecx,0x500 (1280) / cmp edx,0x400 (1024)  -> index 3
cmp ecx,0x400 (1024) / cmp edx,0x300  (768)  -> index 2
cmp ecx,0x320  (800) / cmp edx,0x258  (600)  -> index 1
cmp ecx,0x280  (640) / cmp edx,0x1e0  (480)  -> index 0
```

Anything unmatched falls through to `0x52d329`, a bare `ret 0x24` — the mode is silently
dropped. There is exactly one copy of this chain in the binary.

Immediate VAs per slot (file offset = VA − 0x400000):

| slot | width imm | height imm |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0x52d1d4 | 0x52d1e0 |
| 1 | 0x52d1b6 | 0x52d1be |
| 2 | 0x52d198 | 0x52d1a0 |
| 3 | 0x52d17a | 0x52d182 |
| 4 | 0x52d15c | 0x52d164 |

**How it was found.** Setting slot 2 to 1920x1080 produced a working fullscreen 1920x1080
mode with the HUD correctly laid out across the full width, but the world render clipped
at exactly x=1023/1024 with stale content beyond. Measuring the screenshot ruled out a
pitch/stride shear (row-to-row horizontal shift measured 0.00 px). The clip landed on a
power of two matching no table entry — which pointed at a hardcoded 1024, and a search for
`cmp reg,1024` immediates in `.text` found this chain.

`tools/tropico-patch.py --set` now writes both tables and `--show` reports any mismatch.


## 9. The compare-chain requires UNIQUE WIDTHS — VERIFIED

The chain in §8 dispatches on width and **rejects outright** on a height mismatch, rather
than falling through to the next entry:

```asm
52d15a:  cmp ecx,0x640 (1600)
52d160:  jne 0x52d178          ; width differs -> try the next entry
52d162:  cmp edx,0x4b0 (1200)
52d168:  jne 0x52d329          ; height differs -> REJECT, no further entries tried
```

So the stock table works only because all five widths happen to be distinct. Assigning two
slots the same width makes the later-tested one permanently unreachable.

The chain tests entries in the order **4, 3, 2, 1, 0**.

**Observed:** with slot 1 = 1600x900 and slot 4 = 1600x1200, selecting slot 1 produced
"Unable to change to 1600x900". Mode 1600x900 matched slot 4's width test, failed its
height test, and was rejected before slot 1's own entry was ever reached.

`tools/tropico-patch.py` now warns on any width collision.

### Slot status on the corrected build

| slot | mode | result |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 640x480 | works |
| 3 | 1280x1024 | works |
| 4 | 1600x1200 | works |
| 1 | 1600x900 | rejected — width collision (fixed by using a unique width) |
| 2 | 1920x1080 | mode sets and HUD lays out correctly; **world render still clips** |

Slot 2 remains **open**. Syncing the code chain did not fix the render, so the x=1024 clip
originates somewhere other than the chain immediates.


## 10. Width must be a multiple of 4 (pitch alignment) — MEASURED

The classic Tropico pitch/stride bug, reproduced and quantified. DirectDraw aligns the
surface pitch to an **8-byte** boundary. The game assumes `pitch == width * 2` (16bpp) and
writes rows at that spacing, so any width whose `width*2` is not 8-byte aligned makes every
row drift — a progressive shear down the screen.

Measured with `probes/ddpitch.c`, 16bpp system-memory offscreen surfaces:

| width | width % 16 | width*2 | actual pitch | padding |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 640, 800, 1024, 1152, 1280, 1360, 1400, 1440, 1600, 1680, 1920 | — | — | = width*2 | **0** |
| **1366** | 6 | 2732 | **2736** | **4** |

So the constraint is `width % 4 == 0`, not `% 16`: 1400 (%16 == 8) is fine, 1366 is not.

**Observed:** slot 1 = 1366x768 produced "an extremely smeared and askew image... almost
like wrapping the pixel rows incorrectly" — exactly this shear.

`tools/tropico-patch.py` now REFUSES to build a table entry with `width % 4 != 0`.
It previously only printed a warning, which was easy to miss.

## Constraints on any replacement resolution — summary

1. `width % 4 == 0` (§10), else the image shears.
2. Width must be unique across all five slots (§9), else the slot is unreachable.
3. Prefer a mode in Wine's standard list (§7), else the desktop must equal it exactly.
4. Do not replace slot 0 — it is the menu/frontend resolution and is special-cased in the
   enumerator as always-accepted.
5. Both the data table and the code compare-chain must be updated together (§8).


## 11. The HUD/background is drawn at the slot's STOCK width — MEASURED

Patching all three known locations still leaves the frame clipped. Measurement across three
slots shows the clip lands on the **stock width of whichever slot is used**, regardless of
the resolution actually set:

| slot | stock width | patched to | measured clip |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 800 | 1440x900 | **800** |
| 2 | 1024 | 1920x1080 | **1024** |
| 3 | 1280 | 1440x900 | **1280** |

Two systems disagree about the screen width. The HUD/background art is drawn at the slot's
stock width, anchored left, while widgets (money, date, Tropico logo, tabs) are positioned
from the *real* resolution and land correctly at the right edge. The stone HUD bar is cut
cleanly at the stock width rather than tiled — consistent with a fixed-width bitmap.

No fourth copy of the stock dimensions exists in the binary (searched as DWORD arrays, WORD
arrays, interleaved pairs, and as immediates), so this is almost certainly **per-resolution
art assets** in the PK2 archives, selected by slot index. There are exactly five sets and no
way to synthesise a sixth by patching code.

### The practical consequence

Choose a slot whose **stock width is greater than or equal to the target width**. The art is
then at least as wide as the screen and no unpainted strip remains. This makes slot 4
(stock 1600x1200) the only useful home for a widescreen mode, and caps the usable width at
**1600**.

Best candidate: **slot 4 = 1600x900** — art width 1600 exactly equals target width 1600, and
16:9 exactly. 1920x1080 can never be made clean this way; no art set is 1920 wide.

Vertical does not appear to be affected: in the slot-3 test the art was 1024 tall against a
900-tall screen and the HUD bar still sat correctly at the bottom.


## 12. 1600x900 in slot 4 — world correct, HUD chrome wrong

Configuration: `--set 4=1600x900` (art width 1600 == target width 1600).

**Works:** the game world paints the entire screen at true 16:9. Measured on the
screenshot: zero fully-black columns, zero fully-black rows, 3% black pixels overall
(texture shadow only). No shear, no unpainted strip. The resolution readout in the F2
dialog correctly reads "1600 x 900".

**Still wrong:** HUD chrome authored for a 1200-tall screen.
- notebook tabs (OVERVIEW/GRAPHICS/MEMORY) clipped on the right
- the middle span of the bottom bar is absent; the world shows through between the
  minimap cluster and the logo/treasury cluster
- bottom status text overlaps itself

Corner-anchored clusters are positioned from the real resolution and land correctly; the
fixed art spans do not. So the horizontal half of §11 is solved by matching art width, but
the vertical half remains: no art set is 900 tall.

**Conclusion.** Every stock art set is 4:3 except 1280x1024 (5:4). No widescreen art exists,
so a fully correct widescreen HUD needs re-authored or re-anchored HUD assets — tier 4 work,
not a byte patch. This is the outcome the project brief anticipated.


## 13. The virtual desktop is NOT required — the premise was wrong

The project brief assumed the Wine virtual desktop is mandatory because "Wine can't set a
16bpp mode on a modern compositor". **Measured, that is false.**

`probes/ddnodesk.c`, run with `HKCU\Software\Wine\Explorer\Desktop` deleted, on a
1920x1080 + 2560x1440 XWayland setup:

```
desktop: 1920 x 1080 @ 32 bpp
DirectDrawCreateEx           -> OK
SetCoopLevel EXCLUSIVE|FULL  -> OK
84 modes enumerated | 8bpp=28  16bpp=28  32bpp=28
   SetDisplayMode( 640, 480,16) -> OK
   SetDisplayMode(1024, 768,16) -> OK
   SetDisplayMode(1280,1024,16) -> OK
   SetDisplayMode(1600, 900,16) -> OK
   SetDisplayMode(1600,1200,16) -> 0x80004001 DDERR_UNSUPPORTED
```

Control, with a 1600x1200 virtual desktop: 63 modes (21 per depth), all five succeed.

So **removing the virtual desktop gives MORE 16bpp modes, not fewer** (28 vs 21) — they are
the display's real modes, including 1600x900, 1440x900, 1368x768 and 1920x1080.

**The only failure is 1600x1200**, because modern widescreen panels offer no 4:3 mode that
large. That is Tropico's top stock resolution — and almost certainly the origin of both the
"DirectDraw Error #150" that started this project and the reported "extra slider entry that
crashes". It was never an incomplete table slot; it is the one stock mode the hardware
cannot produce.

### Consequence for tier 1

The virtual desktop is a workaround for a single unsupported resolution, not for 16bpp. A
build whose table contains only modes the actual display supports should run with **no prefix
surgery at all**. Combined with §11 (art width must be >= target width, so slot 4), the
natural configuration is **slot 4 = 1600x900**: 16:9, a real display mode, and matching art
width.

This also means the eventual proxy DLL should populate the table from
`EnumDisplayModes` at runtime rather than hardcoding anything.

**Still to verify:** that the full game (not just the probe) launches and plays with no
virtual desktop. The probe exercises DirectDraw only.


## 14. Hardware 3D is refused by a signed VRAM overflow — MEASURED

`Tropico.lng` string **1721**: *"Hardware 3D is not available on this computer... the card
must have a working DirectX 7 driver and at least 16MB of memory."*

Wine reports plenty of memory and advertises 3D, so the check should pass:

```
HAL dwCaps        = 0xf5408661  (DDCAPS_3D = YES)
HAL dwVidMemTotal = 4286672895 bytes (4088.1 MB)
```

But `4286672895 = 0xFF816FFF`, which as a **signed 32-bit int is -8,294,401**. A check
written `if ((int)dwVidMemTotal < 16*1024*1024) reject;` sees a negative number and refuses.
This is the classic large-VRAM signed overflow that breaks many pre-2005 titles.

Confirmed by capping what Wine reports (`probes/ddcaps.c`):

| `HKCU\Software\Wine\Direct3D\VideoMemorySize` | dwVidMemTotal | as signed | passes |
|---|---|---|---|
| unset | 4,286,672,895 | **-8,294,401** | no |
| 256 | 260,141,056 | 260,141,056 | yes |
| 512 | 528,576,512 | 528,576,512 | yes |

**Zero-patch workaround:** set `VideoMemorySize` to 256. Already applied to
`~/.wine-tropico-gog`.

Not yet verified that the game then accepts Hardware 3D — that needs a run. And note the
brief's warning that the hardware renderer has its own pitch/stride bug on modern GPUs, so
it may render badly even once accepted. Software 3D remains the known-good path.

A permanent fix would patch the comparison from signed to unsigned (`jl` -> `jb`) so no
registry change is needed. The compare site has not been located yet.

## 15. No virtual desktop means no mode switching — content sits top-left

With the virtual desktop removed (§13) the game launches fullscreen, but XWayland does not
actually switch the physical mode. The root stays at the native resolution and the game is
painted at its own size in the **top-left corner**, with the remainder black.

Confirmed by the owner: 640x480 menu in the top-left of a 1920x1080 screen; changing
resolution in-game scales correctly but stays uncentred.

XWayland *does* advertise several modes (1920x1080, 1440x1080, 1400x1050, 1280x1024,
1280x960), so this is emulation rather than a missing mode list.

Options, none yet tested:
- **gamescope** — `gamescope -W 1920 -H 1080 -w 1280 -h 1024 -f -- wine ...` would centre and
  upscale, delivering tier 4's "upscaling/integer scaling" as well. Not packaged on Pop!_OS
  24.04; would need a manual build or another source.
- Run at the display's native mode — but §11 caps clean HUD rendering at 1600 wide.
- Re-introduce a virtual desktop sized to the mode, which reintroduces the setup friction.

**Best fully-correct experience available today without a virtual desktop: 1280x1024** — a
real display mode, art width matches exactly, and the owner confirmed it renders correctly.
Pillarboxed on a 16:9 panel, which the brief explicitly prefers over a stretched image.
